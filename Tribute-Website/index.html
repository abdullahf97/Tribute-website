          <h2>Quaid-e-Azam</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Muhammad Ali Jinnah </b>born Mahomedali Jinnahbhai; 25 December
            1876 – 11 September 1948 was a barrister, politician and the founder
            of Pakistan.[1] Jinnah served as the leader of the All-India Muslim
            League from 1913 until the inception of Pakistan on 14 August 1947,
            and then as the Dominion of Pakistan's first governor-general until
            his death. He is revered in Pakistan as the Quaid-e-Azam ("Great
            Leader") and Baba-e-Qaum ("Father of the Nation"). His birthday is
            observed as a national holiday in Pakistan. Born at Wazir Mansion in
            Karachi, Jinnah was trained as a barrister at Lincoln's Inn in
            London, England. Upon his return to India, he enrolled at the Bombay
            High Court, and took an interest in national politics, which
            eventually replaced his legal practice. Jinnah rose to prominence in
            the Indian National Congress in the first two decades of the 20th
            century. In these early years of his political career, Jinnah
            advocated Hindu–Muslim unity, helping to shape the 1916 Lucknow Pact
            between the Congress and the All-India Muslim League, in which
            Jinnah had also become prominent. Jinnah became a key leader in the
            All-India Home Rule League, and proposed a fourteen-point
            constitutional reform plan to safeguard the political rights of
            Muslims in the Indian subcontinent. In 1920, however, Jinnah
            resigned from the Congress when it agreed to follow a campaign of
            satyagraha, which he regarded as political anarchy. By 1940, Jinnah
            had come to believe that the Muslims of the subcontinent should have
            their own state to avoid the possible marginalised status they may
            gain in an independent Hindu–Muslim state. In that year, the Muslim
            League, led by Jinnah, passed the Lahore Resolution, demanding a
            separate nation for Indian Muslims. During the Second World War, the
            League gained strength while leaders of the Congress were
            imprisoned, and in the provincial elections held shortly after the
            war, it won most of the seats reserved for Muslims. Ultimately, the
            Congress and the Muslim League could not reach a power-sharing
            formula that would allow the entirety of British India to be united
            as a single state following independence, leading all parties to
            agree instead to the independence of a predominantly Hindu India,
            and for a Muslim-majority state of Pakistan.
